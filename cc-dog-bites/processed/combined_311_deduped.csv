Per Victim's To/From: 

""I was  volunteering in Cat Room showing cats  I petted Goldie & he was fine. I took him out to show him t folks & was holding & petting him. After about 2-5 minutes w/o warning he went at me with all four claws - I have about 10 scratches on my left arm  & 3-4 on my face. I don't think it bit me but can't say for certain since he went at me w/ paws & mouth. I washed it all w/ soap & water.
